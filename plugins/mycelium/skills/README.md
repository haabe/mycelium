# Skills — 44 Reusable Agent Operations

Skills are composable operations the agent can perform. Each skill is a structured prompt with a defined workflow, inputs, outputs, and theory citations. They are invoked with `/skill-name` (e.g., `/interview`, `/threat-model`, `/dora-check`).

Every skill lives in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file that defines the complete workflow.

## Skills by Phase

### Delivery (L4)
| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/delivery-bootstrap` | Bootstrap a delivery diamond with JiT tooling |
| `/preflight` | Pre-task safety check (corrections, secrets, scope) |
| `/reflexion` | Implement → validate → self-critique → retry loop |

| `/retrospective` | Structured retrospective after delivery |
| `/regulatory-review` | EU AI Act and regulatory compliance check |
| `/team-shape` | Assess team topology (Skelton & Pais) |

### Framework Operations
| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/framework-health` | Quarterly framework self-assessment |
| `/eval-runner` | Run evaluation scenarios against the framework |
| `/fan-out` | Parallel exploration with worktree-isolated agents |
| `/prompt-optimizer` | A/B test and optimize framework prompts |

## Skill Anatomy

Every `SKILL.md` follows this structure:

1. **When to Use** — conditions that trigger the skill
2. **Workflow** — numbered steps the agent follows
3. **Output** — what gets written and where
4. **Theory Citations** — which frameworks inform the skill

Skills are suggested contextually by `/diamond-assess` and `/diamond-progress` at phase transitions, and by hooks when relevant conditions are detected.
