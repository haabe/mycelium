# Define Done

Pin an explicit, outcome-based **Definition of Done** for a diamond. "Done" is *a change in human behaviour that creates value* (Seiden), not "the feature shipped" — you're done when it ships **and** has the intended impact (Amplitude). The diamond's implicit done defaults to the harshest, least-controllable bar ("a user shipped a product"), which is both wrong for validating *purpose* and a demotivation engine. This skill makes the bar explicit, measurable, and pre-committed.

This is distinct from `/mycelium:definition-of-done` (the per-feature agile *quality checklist* run at Deliver→Complete). This skill sets the **outcome bar a whole diamond is judged against**; that one verifies a feature meets quality criteria. Both can apply.

## When to use

- **At diamond birth** — `/mycelium:interview` (L0) and child-diamond spawn (`/mycelium:diamond-progress`) call this before a diamond is "live."
- **Retrofit** — when `/mycelium:canvas-health`, `/mycelium:diamond-assess`, or the SessionStart nudge flags a diamond with no `definition_of_done`.
- Never silent-fill. The *question* is what produces a real bar ("fits, not ships"); a back-filled field is theatre.

## Preflight: Read target file before any Write/Edit

**Hard rule.** The `definition_of_done` field lives on the diamond in `.claude/diamonds/active.yml`. Before `Write`/`Edit` on it, use the **Read tool** on that file this session (`cat`/`head`/`grep` via Bash do NOT satisfy Claude Code's check). `Edit` with `limit:1` suffices for a partial update; full Read before a `Write`. See `CLAUDE.md` *Canvas writes — Read before Write*.

## The sequence (Socratic, problem-first)

Ask these in order. The teaching is in the **sequencing** (problem → signal → maybe-number → kill) and the good/bad contrast — not a help doc. Reject build-lists at step 1; that is the whole point.

**1. "When this is done, what's different — and for WHOM?"** → `outcome` + whose behaviour.
   Lead with the problem and the person, never the deliverable (Cagan: "most measurement problems are clarity problems").
   - ✗ *"the onboarding flow ships."* (a build-list — reject it)
   - ✓ *"non-fluent users get through the brief without hitting the vocabulary wall."*

**2. "What's the ONE thing you'd SEE them DO that proves it?"** → `signal` (One Metric That Matters — one, not many).
   - ✗ *"it feels better."*
   - ✓ *"they came back for a second session."*

**3. *(optional)* "Is there a point where it's ENOUGH?"** → `threshold`, only if one genuinely fits.
   A number is **optional, not mandatory** — directional outcomes are legitimate. When you do set one, pair it with a qualitative guard ("3 warm bodies who bounce ≠ done") so it can't be gamed (Goodhart).

**4. Pre-mortem for the invalidation criterion** (schema key `kill_criterion`; the name is the worst reading of what it is — a pre-committed state and date at which the goal is shown WRONG, which is a completion path, not a termination; see `diamond-rules.md` Deliver→Complete). Ask in the past tense: *"It's [review date]. This diamond failed. What happened?"* (premortem finds ~30% more real failure reasons than "might it fail?" — Klein). From the answer derive a concrete **state + date** that means *kill, not finish*:
   - `state` — an objective benchmark that means this goal is **wrong**.
   - `date` — the review date by which the state must hold. Pre-commit BOTH, before the data (anti-HARKing).
   Invalidation-with-evidence at that date is a legitimate "done" — routed through `/mycelium:diamond-progress kill` + `dogfood-mode`, not silently declared.
   - `on_expiry` — **what happens when the date passes and NEITHER the outcome nor the kill has fired (v0.227.0).** Most results land between the lines, and a bar that is silent there stays open for good. The default is **stop**, or re-pitch as a NEW bar with a new written date. "Otherwise the bet continues" is not an answer: it is how a bar stays in limbo with every field filled. A bar written as an ordered `branches` list may say this in a last line whose `when` is "anything else".

**5. Hand the bar to someone who did not write it, before you accept it (v0.227.0).** Invent a handful of result sets, including awkward ones between the lines, and ask a reader who has NOT seen the conversation to say what the bar tells you to do in each. For a solo builder the reader is a blind subagent given only the bar's text. If they have to ask what a word means, or two cases resolve to nothing, the bar is not done: fix the wording and ask a FRESH reader. Record the result on the bar as `reader_test: {date, reader, cases, resolved, note}`. This step is not optional polish. Dogfood 2026-09-17: the author ran every mechanical check on four successive drafts of one bar and all four passed; a blind reader found a real defect in each (an extension rule that read two ways, a kill tied to an exact count that one extra offer missed, "the last taker" with nobody to refer to). The author checks the bar he meant; the reader checks the bar he wrote. And because a self-written stop rule is the weakest kind there is (Boulding et al. 1997: pre-committing to a rule you wrote yourself barely reduces escalation; a rule someone else applies does), the same reader, or another, applies the bar again AT its date. `check_dod_shape.py` reports a bar with no `on_expiry` and no `reader_test`, as advisories.

## Per-scale "done" + lead/lag defaults

Default `kind` by altitude: lower/activity scales take **leading** measures (predictive, team-influenceable); higher value-validation scales take **lagging** (already realized). Direct most attention to lead measures (4DX).

| Scale | "Done" means | `kind` default |
|---|---|---|
| L0 Purpose | people **keep choosing it** ("fits, not ships") | lagging |
| L1 Strategy | a where-to-play **bet validated** | lagging |
| L2 Opportunity | a real user need **confirmed worth solving** | mixed |
| L3 Solution | the solution **actually solves it** for users (not just built) | leading |
| L4 Delivery | shipped **AND** has the intended impact | leading |
| L5 Market | **adoption / business outcome** at scale | lagging |

## Build-mode gate — refuse build-to-earn during build-to-learn

The per-scale table isn't only a `kind` default — it encodes the **build mode** (Patton/Cagan). This skill enforces it at diamond birth (agent-adjudicated), with a `/canvas-health` lint backstop that fires unconditionally (step 8c there). This is the mechanism behind philosophy.md's *"the framework refuses to let the agent build-to-earn during a build-to-learn phase — that refusal is the gate."*

- **Build-to-LEARN** (a diamond whose terminal purpose is to *learn* — scales L0 Purpose → L3 Solution): its DoD `outcome` must be a **learning / validation** result ("the bet is validated", "the need is confirmed worth solving", "the solution actually solves it for users").
- **Build-to-EARN** (terminal purpose is to *ship value* — L4 Delivery, L5 Market): its DoD `outcome` is a **shipped-value / adoption** result ("shipped **AND** the intended impact landed").

**The discriminator is NOT the word "ship" — it is what the done-bar IS.** Discovery legitimately *ships to learn*: a fake-door test, wizard-of-oz, a disposable prototype shipped to a few opted-in users. Those are build-to-LEARN — the ship is the *method*, the *learning it yields* is the done-bar ("40% of the 5 opted-in users returned = demand validated"). Do NOT reject those.

**The gate — reject a build-to-LEARN diamond's DoD only when it is genuinely earn-shaped**, i.e. either:
- the **ship itself is the done-bar** (no learning behind it — "the flow is deployed" as the terminal criterion), OR
- **scope is all-users / permanent / production-hardened** rather than select opt-in (reuse G-M2's opted-in-vs-all-users line).

Then say: *"That's build-to-earn on a build-to-learn diamond — you haven't earned delivery yet (Patton/Cagan). What will this ship let you LEARN? Make the learning the done-bar, keep the ship disposable / opt-in. Production rollout is the L4 outcome, earned after discovery validates."* This is **distinct from the step-1 build-list rejection**: step 1 catches *"the flow ships"* as a non-outcome; this catches a well-formed but **premature earn-bar**. Conversely, a build-to-EARN (L4) diamond whose `outcome` is pure learning with **no value/impact** → prompt to reframe to earn ("shipped **AND** moved [signal]").

**Boundary note (mode is per-phase; the DoD bar is per-diamond).** The DoD keys to the diamond's *terminal purpose* (its scale), but build mode shifts *across a diamond's phases*: even an L4 Delivery diamond has an early Discover/Develop phase (a spike, "how should we build this?") that is build-to-learn — don't force its early spike into an earn-bar. And a build-to-EARN L4 child under a build-to-LEARN parent ships (earn) yet rolls up to the parent's *learning* (`rolls_up_to`). philosophy.md frames the line by **phase** (Discover/Develop divergent = learn; Define/Deliver convergent = earn); this skill keys the *DoD outcome* to the diamond's terminal **altitude** — the same distinction, applied to the artifact each governs.

**Scenarios** — *happy:* L4 "shipped X and retention rose" ✓; L1 "the where-to-play bet is validated" ✓; L2 "fake-door: 40% of opted-in users clicked through = demand validated" ✓ (ships, but to learn). *sad (redirect):* L2 "ship the onboarding flow" (ship = the bar, no learning) → reframe to the need it must confirm first. *bad (blocked):* L0/L1 "deploy production auth to all users" → earn-during-learn, the "earn the right to start" gate firing.

**Ladder rule (contribution-not-summation):** a child diamond is done only when its outcome **rolls up** to move the parent outcome / validate the parent assumption — not just because the child shipped. A child that doesn't roll up is discarded, not summed. Set `rolls_up_to` on every child.

## Write the field

Write `definition_of_done` onto the target diamond in `.claude/diamonds/active.yml`:

```yaml
definition_of_done:
  outcome:   "<what changes, for WHOM — a behaviour, not a feature>"   # required; problem-first
  signal:    "<the ONE observable thing you'd see them DO>"            # required; OMTM
  kind:      leading | lagging                                        # defaulted by scale above
  threshold: "<a target IF one genuinely fits>"                       # OPTIONAL (numbers not mandatory)
  measure:                                                            # OPTIONAL — makes `signal` checkable post-ship; closes the outcome→discovery loop (/metrics-pull reads this)
    source:      "<metric adapter key (github, plausible, …) OR 'manual' for interview/observation outcomes>"
    field:       "<snapshot field path for automated sources; omit for source: manual>"
    target:      "<value or direction that means the outcome landed — reuse `threshold` if already set>"
    check_after: "<lag before checking, as Nd or Nw after ship (e.g. 14d, 8w) — matched to `kind`. Per-DoD; consumed by /metrics-pull's lag gate + the overdue nudge. Default 14d if unset>"
    guardrail:   "<counter-metric that must NOT worsen while `signal` improves — Goodhart guard (advisory: downgrades a 'met' to 'met-with-regression')>"
    last_checked: null                                                # stamped by /metrics-pull when the outcome-check runs
  rolls_up_to: "<parent diamond id + which parent outcome this serves>"  # child diamonds only
  kill_criterion:                                                       # the invalidation criterion; schema key kept for compatibility
    state: "<concrete benchmark that means this goal is WRONG>"
    date:  "<YYYY-MM-DD review date by which state must hold>"
    premortem: "<the failure it was generated from>"
    on_expiry: "<what happens when the date passes and neither outcome nor kill fired — default STOP, or re-pitch as a new bar with a new date; never 'continues'>"
  reader_test: { date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>", reader: "<blind subagent | a named person>", cases: 0, resolved: 0, note: "<what they had to ask about>" }   # step 5; re-run at the bar's date
  provenance: { source_class: internal_stakeholder, validated: false, captured_at: "<YYYY-MM-DD>" }
  log: []                                                               # dated updates go here: [{date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>", text: "<what was scored, re-specified or ruled>"}]
```

**The bar and its log are two things (v0.225.0).** `outcome`, `signal`, `threshold` and `kill_criterion` are the BAR: what the owner steers by, short enough to state from memory. Everything that happens to the bar afterwards (a sweep scored against the kill criterion, a re-specification, a ruling, a tally) is an entry appended to `log[]` as `{date, text}`. **Never add a dated key (`state_2026_09_01:`, `sweep_3_result:`) beside or inside the bar, and never grow `kill_criterion.state` into a history of itself.** When the bar itself changes, rewrite the bar field and put the OLD wording and the reason in a log entry. Dogfood 2026-09-16: a Definition of Done reached 76,904 characters, 59,229 of them dated notes under `kill_criterion`, and its owner could not state it; after the notes moved to `log[]` the bar was still 21,559 characters, so moving the log out is necessary and does not by itself make the bar short. When re-running this skill on an existing diamond, run `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check_dod_shape.py" --diamond-id <id>` first and show the owner the bar size before asking whether the bar still says what they mean.

`outcome` and `signal` are required; everything else is optional or scale-defaulted. At L0/L1 birth from the brief, a one-line `outcome` + `signal` stub is enough — depth comes from re-running this skill.

### `measure` — closing the outcome→discovery loop (optional)

Setting a DoD target and never checking whether it landed leaves the back half of the loop open (Kim's Second Way: outcomes must flow back). The optional `measure` block makes `signal` checkable after ship, so `/metrics-pull` can compare target-vs-actual and route the result back to discovery (met → confidence up / scale; missed → reopen the opportunity). Design notes, all evidence-grounded:

- **`source: manual` is first-class, not a fallback.** Many real outcomes — especially early, and any that depend on real users experiencing the thing — are interview/observation-based, not dashboard numbers. `measure` must NOT push you to pick the number you can automate over the outcome you care about (the metric-availability trap). Manual outcomes get *prompted*, not faked.
- **`check_after` is per-DoD, never a global window.** Outcome lag varies by what you measure (engagement lands in days; retention in weeks or months). Match it to `kind` — leading measures check sooner, lagging later — long enough to capture real signal, short enough to still act on it. Written as `Nd`/`Nw`; `/metrics-pull` skips the check (no false "missed") and the nudge stays quiet until it elapses.
- **`guardrail` is the Goodhart guard (advisory, with teeth).** When `signal` becomes a target it degrades; pair it with a counter-metric that must not worsen. It doesn't block, but `/metrics-pull` downgrades a "met" to "met-with-regression" when the guardrail worsened as the signal improved. Five metrics are harder to game than one.
- Omit `measure` entirely for a directional outcome with no meaningful check — that stays valid.

## Purpose-stance check on the bar you just wrote (WARN — never blocks)

**Run it after writing the field:**

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check_purpose_stance.py"
```

**What it is for, and it is not the solution check wearing a different hat.** A definition of done is
the one artifact that says what this diamond is FOR. If it drifts from the product's own why/how/what,
every downstream gate can pass while the diamond delivers something the product no longer claims to be.
That drift is invisible by construction: nothing else in the framework reads a `definition_of_done`
against the purpose.

**The failure this closes, measured on the dogfood project 2026-08-23.** An L1 outcome was re-specified
on 2026-08-15; the `why` and `what` were rewritten on 2026-08-23 and the binding properties derived from
them the same day. **The bar was therefore written eight days before the definition it had to satisfy
existed, and nothing re-read it.** The founder found it by asking out loud whether it still fit — not
from any check. Worse, the script that would have answered him did not open `active.yml` at all until
plugin 0.123.0.

**If the diamond has no `purpose_stance`, ask for one now, while the bar is fresh.** This is the cheapest
moment: the builder has just articulated what done means, so the question "does this contradict what you
said the product is?" is a continuation of the conversation, not an audit weeks later.

**NEVER auto-fill it.** An agent-written `preserves` with no human read is the filler trap with extra
steps, and a `contradicts` verdict may only be overridden by a human. If the builder does not want to
answer now, leave the field absent — the WARN is the true state and it will keep reporting. **Absent is
honest; invented is not.**

**Exit is always 0 here.** This is firing point 7 in the wiring spec — WARN, never fail. A definition of
done must never be blocked by a stance check, or the skill that exists to make "done" concrete becomes
one more thing to satisfy first.

## Failure-mode guards (baked in)

- **No checklist theatre** — step 1 rejects "what you built"; the field is an outcome.
- **No Goodhart** — number optional; when set, pair with a qualitative guard.
- **Invalidation-path honesty** — done-by-invalidation requires the pre-committed state+date to have actually **fired with evidence** at the scheduled gate, logged via `dogfood-mode` + decision-log. It is not a way to declare failed work done.
- **Problem-first sequencing** prevents the metric-availability trap (picking the number you can measure over the outcome you care about).

## Provisional wording

The exact prompt phrasing above is **provisional** — only the why → who → how-should-behaviour-change → what scaffold (Impact Mapping) survived research verification; the specific wording did not. Validate it with `/mycelium:prompt-optimizer` A/B rather than treating the phrasing as settled. Design + evidence grades: `docs/design/definition-of-done.md`.
