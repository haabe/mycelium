# Skills index

**Audience**: practitioners looking up a skill, evaluators surveying capability surface.
**Time to read**: 5 min for the table; depth lives in each `SKILL.md`.
**Last updated**: 2026-05-08.

This index lists all 45 skills (45 skills total). Each skill's full behaviour lives in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (loaded JIT by Claude Code). This page is an orientation map by phase; [by-category.md](by-category.md) is the alternate index by category of work.

## How to use this index

If you are mid-diamond and want a skill: look at the phase section that matches your scale. If you are auditing: look at audit & governance. If you are doing framework-level work: look at self-improvement.

Skills are auto-discovered from `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter — Claude Code reads them at session start. Adding a skill is creating a new directory + SKILL.md; this index then needs updating per the [version-discipline](../../.claude/engine/version-discipline.md) rule on material framework changes.
